/**
 * OrientationComplimentaryFilter estimates the orientation of the devices based on a sensor fusion of a
 * gyroscope, accelerometer and magnetometer. The filter is backed by a quaternion based complimentary filter.
 * <p>
 * The complementary filter is a frequency domain filter. In its strictest
 * sense, the definition of a complementary filter refers to the use of two or
 * more transfer functions, which are mathematical complements of one another.
 * Thus, if the data from one sensor is operated on by G(s), then the data from
 * the other sensor is operated on by I-G(s), and the sum of the transfer
 * functions is I, the identity matrix.
 * <p>
 * OrientationComplimentaryFilter attempts to fuse magnetometer, gravity and gyroscope
 * sensors together to produce an accurate measurement of the rotation of the
 * device.
 * <p>
 * The magnetometer and acceleration sensors are used to determine one of the
 * two orientation estimations of the device. This measurement is subject to the
 * constraint that the device must not be accelerating and hard and soft-iron
 * distortions are not present in the local magnetic field..
 * <p>
 * The gyroscope is used to determine the second of two orientation estimations
 * of the device. The gyroscope can have a shorter response time and is not
 * effected by linear acceleration or magnetic field distortions, however it
 * experiences drift and has to be compensated periodically by the
 * acceleration/magnetic sensors to remain accurate.
 * <p>
 * Quaternions are used to integrate the measurements of the gyroscope and apply
 * the rotations to each sensors measurements via complementary filter. This the
 * ideal method because quaternions are not subject to many of the singularties
 * of rotation matrices, such as gimbal lock.
 * <p>
 * The quaternion for the magnetic/acceleration sensor is only needed to apply
 * the weighted quaternion to the gyroscopes weighted quaternion via
 * complementary filter to produce the fused rotation. No integrations are
 * required.
 * <p>
 * The gyroscope provides the angular rotation speeds for all three axes. To
 * find the orientation of the device, the rotation speeds must be integrated
 * over time. This can be accomplished by multiplying the angular speeds by the
 * time intervals between sensor updates. The calculation produces the rotation
 * increment. Integrating these values again produces the absolute orientation
 * of the device. Small errors are produced at each iteration causing the gyro
 * to drift away from the true orientation.
 * <p>
 * To eliminate both the drift and noise from the orientation, the gyroscope
 * measurements are applied only for orientation changes in short time
 * intervals. The magnetometer/acceleration fusion is used for long time
 * intervals. This is equivalent to low-pass filtering of the accelerometer and
 * magnetic field sensor signals and high-pass filtering of the gyroscope
 * signals.
